# Thesis Simulation Repository

This GitHub repository was created for the thesis I am doing at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
The data uploaded here is from the RailSys simulations I have run.

## Alternatives (Infrastructure)
- **Current Infrastructure**
- **Four-track Station through the core**
- **Four-Track Station added to Stockholm Odenplan**
- **Four-Track Station added to Stockholms Södra**
- **Four-Track Station added to Årstaberg**

## Scenarios

The simulations cover the following scenarios with different frequencies of trains per hour:
- **16 trains per hour**
- **24 trains per hour**
- **30 trains per hour**

### Scenario 1: 16 Trains per Hour
In this scenario, the lines are analyzed with a frequency of 16 trains per hour. 

### Scenario 2: 24 Trains per Hour
This scenario increases the frequency to 24 trains per hour. This scenario is the aim and goal for the operators.

### Scenario 3: 30 Trains per Hour
The most intense scheduling scenario accommodates 30 trains per hour. This can be seen as a wish and a stress scenario.

## Simulation Results
The simulation results include different punctuality values, specifically:
- **RT +3**: 3:59
- **RT +5**: 5:59

Feel free to explore the repository to see the detailed outputs of these simulations. fix the text, like for the scenarios
